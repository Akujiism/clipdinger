{"name":"Clipdinger","tagline":"A tool to manage a history of the system clipboard","body":"![Clipdinger icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/humdingerb/clipdinger/master/images/clipdinger_icon_64.png) **Clipdinger** for [Haiku](http://www.haiku-os.org)\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nClipdinger is a small tool to manage a history of the system clipboard. It solves the problem that you often have to paste some text you've just recently copied to the clipboard, but that has been replaced by something you've copied more recently... It also saves the history so it'll appear just as you left it on the last shutdown.\r\n\r\nIf you want to paste some text that isn't in the clipboard any more, simply hit _SHIFT_ + _ALT_ + _V_ to summon the Clipdinger window. Here you can select an entry with the _CursorUp/Down_ keys and put it into the clipboard or auto-paste it by hitting _RETURN_.\r\n_ESCAPE_  or _ALT_ + _W_ aborts and minimizes the Clipdinger window.\r\n\r\nHere's the main window with a few entries in the history and the settings window when choosing _Settings..._ from the History menu:\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/humdingerb/clipdinger/master/images/clipdinger.png)\r\n\r\nFor easier orientation, the icon of the app that a clip was copied from is drawn to the left of the text. The top entry is always what's currently in the clipboard.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the settings window, you can set the number of entries in the history (the default is 50).\r\nKeep in mind that every clipping is kept in memory and if you copy many large blocks of text, you may clog up your memory. Though, for everyday use, where clippings are seldom larger than a few KiBs at most, having a few dozen entries in the history shouldn't tax memory noticeably.\r\n\r\nOnce the limit of the history is reached, the oldest entry is removed automatically to make room for the new clipping.\r\n\r\nYou can remove an entry by selecting it and pressing _DEL_ or choose _Remove clip_ from the context menu. You remove the complete clipboard history with _Clear history_ from the _History_ menu.\r\n\r\n_Auto-paste_ will put the clipping you've chosen via double-click or _RETURN_ into the window that was active before you have summoned Clipdinger.\r\n\r\nThe other settings belong to the fading feature: When the checkbox _Fade history entries over time_ is active, entries get darker as time ticks on. You can set the intervall that entries are being tinted (_Delay_) and by how much they are tinted (_Steps_). Below the sliders is a summary of your setting in plain English.\r\n\r\n### Tips & Tricks\r\n\r\n*   Obviously, Clipdinger can only keep a clipboard history while it's running. You should therefore create a link to it in the `/boot/home/config/settings/boot/launch/` folder. Then it gets started automatically on every boot-up.\r\n*   If you leave your computer or just know that you won't do any copy&paste for a long time, you can simply quit Clidinger with _ALT_ + _Q_ to prevent the entries in the history from fading. Clipdinger always starts in same state it was in when it was quit.\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n\r\nClipdinger is directly available through HaikuDepot from the HaikuPorts repository. You can also build it yourself using [Haikuporter](https://github.com/haikuports). The source is hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/humdingerb/clipdinger).\r\n\r\n### Bugreports & Feedback\r\n\r\nPlease use GitHubs's [issue tracker](https://github.com/humdingerb/clipdinger/issues) if you experience unusual difficulties or email your general feedback to [me](mailto:humdingerb@gmail.com).
